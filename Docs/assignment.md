Expected effort: 2 - 8 hours, based on your experience and agent speed.
You can make it your own, but basic problem statement should be solved.

Problem statement A: Private Knowledge Q&A (your mini workspace)
Build a web app where I can:
* add a few documents (text files are enough)
* see the list of uploaded documents
* ask a question
* get an answer
* see “where the answer came from” (show which document and the part of it that helped)
Make it your own: for example, you can choose how documents are stored and how the UI looks.

What to include
* A simple home page with clear steps
* A status page, that shows health of backend, database, and llm connection.
* Basic handling for empty/wrong input
* A short README: how to run, what is done, what is not done
* A short AI_NOTES.md: what you used AI for, and what you checked yourself. Which LLM and provider does your app use and why.
* Put your name and resume in ABOUTME.md
* A PROMPTS_USED.md, with records of your prompts used for app developemnt. Don’t include agent responses, api keys, etc.

Hosting requirement
* Hosting is important for this role.
* Keep the app live after you submit.
* If you truly cannot host, you may submit without hosting only if:
* the repo runs with one command using Docker, and
* you explain why hosting was not possible
* This will be scored lower than a hosted submission.
* If your link is down during review, you get one chance to fix it.

Rules for Github repo
* Do not put API keys or passwords in the code.
* Use a .env.example file for settings.

How we review
We will open the live link and try a few actions.Then we will read your GitHub repo.
We look for:
* it works and is easy to use
* clean code
* basic checks and testing
* sensible use of AI (not blind copy-paste)
