## 1. Initial Planning

**Prompt:**
> Go through the doc and make a markdown file for the implementation plan for implementing "Problem statement A: Private Knowledge Q&A (your mini workspace)". Build a web app where I can: add a few documents (text files are enough), see the list of uploaded documents, ask a question, get an answer, see "where the answer came from" (show which document and the part of it that helped).

**Purpose:** Initial project planning and architecture design.
